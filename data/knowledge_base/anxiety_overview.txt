Anxiety disorders are a group of mental health conditions characterized by excessive fear, worry, or nervousness. Common types include generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and specific phobias. Symptoms often include restlessness, increased heart rate, sleep disturbances, and muscle tension.

Anxiety may be caused by genetic, environmental, or neurological factors. It is commonly treated using cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), medications such as SSRIs or benzodiazepines, and mindfulness practices. Accurate diagnosis involves clinical interviews and psychological assessments based on DSM-5 criteria.

Patients with chronic anxiety are at higher risk for comorbid conditions like depression, substance abuse, and cardiovascular issues.
