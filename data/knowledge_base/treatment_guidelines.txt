Treatment guidelines for anxiety disorders emphasize a multi-modal approach:

1. **Psychotherapy**
   - First-line: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
   - Other options: Exposure Therapy, Acceptance & Commitment Therapy (ACT)

2. **Pharmacological Interventions**
   - SSRIs (e.g., sertraline, fluoxetine) are first-line medications
   - SNRIs and benzodiazepines may be used in treatment-resistant cases
   - Monitor side effects such as insomnia, agitation, or GI issues

3. **Lifestyle & Support**
   - Encourage regular physical activity
   - Recommend mindfulness meditation and breathing exercises
   - Ensure strong patient-provider communication and follow-ups

Treatment should be personalized based on the patient's history, response to prior interventions, and presence of comorbid conditions.
